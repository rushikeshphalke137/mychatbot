    text: A "forecast" is the predicted number of people expected to fall ill from
      a disease. It can be very difficult to make accurate forecasts for epidemics
      because there are many unknowns, and people frequently adjust their behavior
      if they see case counts going up, so forecasts tend to worsen the further you
      go into the future.

    text: When we say "hospitalizations" or "weekly hospitalizations", we are referring
      to the projected hospital admissions in a given region for the selected week.
      It does not include people who were admitted in previous weeks and are still
      in the hospital in the selected week.

    text: MRDD stands for Medical Resource Demand Dashboard. This application allows
      users to see which areas are likely to see shortages of hospital resources based
      on projected hospitalizations due to COVID-19. Below are few of the questions
      which I can answer related to MRDD.

    text: Percentage of occupied beds is the percentage of the total hospital capacity
      of beds for a given region that are projected to be filled in the selected week.  This
      equation does anticipate that a percentage of the beds are filled with non-COVID-19
      patients (by default, 80%) and that, and we report only the maximum percentage
      for the "worst" day (ie, so if the percentage of occupied beds was projected
      to be 99% on Wednesday, and 80% the rest of the week, this application would
      report 99%.)  This value also depends on the average duration of COVID-19 hospital
      stays (a person who enters the hospital and stays for 8 days will be occupying
      the bed on each of the eight days.)

    text: Projections are used to get a general trend of expected COVID-19 cases over
      time to answer questions like, "When are cases likely to peak?" and "What interventions
      are likely to flatten or delay the peak?"  Forecasts try to answer the question,
      "How many people are likely to get ill?", but can be difficult to calculate
      because of unknowns, and tend to be less reliable the further into the future
      they go.

    text: At NSSAC, we develop projections of future COVID-19 activity. These numbers
      are not expected to be exact, but they should show expected trends in COVID-19
      prevalence.  Because we are providing projections instead of forecasts, we can
      focus more on trends rather than specific numbers.

    text: Scenarios consider what would happen to the number of COVID-19 cases over
      time under differing conditions; another way to look at it is that scenarios
      answer the "What If?" questions. For example, scenarios could measure the impact
      of interventions- "What if we close the schools?" "What if a vaccine is ready
      in October?"  It can also consider the timing of events- "What if we have a
      surge in the beginning of October vs. the end of November?" or the magnitude
      of different events- "What would happen if we have a big surge in October? Would
      it lead to lower activity in November than a smaller surge in October?" Scenarios
      can give us insight into the different ways the pandemic may play out.
